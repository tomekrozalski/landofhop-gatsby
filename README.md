  Land of Hop on Gatsby.js
</h1>

I learn web development by creating online beer catalog 🍻. For long months I searched tools which would help me with that efficiently. I picked React and I created [first version](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop) of my app. It was CRA with Formik, Styled Components and other libraries which I found usefull. I also tried tools which I found great, but not completly fullfill my needs: [TypeScript](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-ts), Flow Type, [Svelte with Sapper](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-svelte), [Next.js](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-nextjs) and many other 🔨. I learned Node with Express and Mongoose to create [back-end API](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-back). I have got also MongoDB with my beverages data 💾.  
  
🚀 Finally I decided to build the app using Gatsby. Work is in progress…
